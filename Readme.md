# StackOverflowApp challenge


Thank you for the opportuinity to complete this challenge. 

All the requirments of the challenge are met.

The challenge requirments are missing the image so once the input for the 5 fields is provided in Add Users Screen, users table view does not present any image for the new added element. This is something which would have need to be addressed with product team in real life. The UI in Add Users Screen must have an UIImagePickerController which would allow to chose an image from a camera or a camera roll to provide this image for the gravatar for a new element of the users table view.
